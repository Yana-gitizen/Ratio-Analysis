I created  this template to calculate the most important ratios for businesses.
I simply replace the figures in Column B with figures from client accounts. The ratios will be automatically generated in Column B below the Balance Sheet. 
I then help the client review these ratios in conjunction with other ratios, industry benchmarks, competitor performance, and historical trends to get a complete picture of the client company's financial health.
Based on this template, here are some common Questions I can quickly answer for clients on a live call:
1) Is there a bankruptcy risk or potential cash crunch?
2) Can the company get more leverage or are lenders likely to deny credit?
3) Is my product indicating high or low demand?
4) What are my operational bottlenecks?
5) How can I prevent Storage cost from building up?
6) Do I need to change my business model?
7) Is my business scaling profitably?
8) Should I reinvest in ads or inventory?
9) Etc...
