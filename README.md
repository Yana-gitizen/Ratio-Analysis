I created  this template to calculate the most important ratios for businesses.
I simply replace the figures in Column B with figures from client accounts. The ratios will be automatically generated in Column B below the Balance Sheet. 
I then help the client review these ratios in conjunction with other ratios, industry benchmarks, competitor performance, and historical trends to get a complete picture of the client company's financial health.
